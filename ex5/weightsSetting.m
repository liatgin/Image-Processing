% WEIGHTSSETTING Given 3 nearest neighbors for each patch of the input image
% Find a threshold (maximum distance) for each input patch.
% Next, give a weight for each candidate based on its distance from the input patch.
% denote m,n such that [m,n]=size(pyr{4})
% Arguments:
% imPatches - (m - 4)  (n - 4)  5  5 matrix with the patches that were sampled from the input image (pyr{4})
% Dists - (m - 4)  (n - 4)  3 matrix with the distances returned from findNearestNeighbors.
% pyr - 7  1 cell created using createPyramid
% dbPatchesStd - (m - 4)  (n - 4)  3 matrix with the STDs of the neighbors patches returned from
% findNearestNeighbors.
% Outputs:
% weights - (m - 4)  (n - 4)  3 matrix with the weights for each DB candidates
